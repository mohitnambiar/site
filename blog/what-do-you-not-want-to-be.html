            I recently stumbled upon an <a class="postlink" href="http://time.com/3881954/matthew-mcconaughey-graduation-speech-university-of-houston/">article</a> 
            in the Time magazine, which had the excerpt of the inimitable Matthew McConaughey’s commencement address at the University of Houston.
            If his regular antics and deeds weren't enough to inspire most viewers to stop in their tracks and take notice, this speech just shot his status 
            to near <i>interstellar</i> levels.
            As the man sat on a stool, spewing out life lessons by the dozen and then one, I can only but imagine how it must have felt to get all that 
            knowledge, real time, in McConaughey tongue.

            Without digressing too much, I’ll share a few thoughts on what really stood out to me from the entire speech. 
            For some context, I'm presently going through one of those ‘lack of clarity’ phases in life — reaching out to any and every resource that can help 
            me get the stuff in my dome in order. 
            Reading and reflection constitute a huge chunk of my day. And there couldn't have been a better time to come across this:
            <blockquote class="bq">Defining ourselves by what we are NOT is the first step that leads us to really KNOWING WHO WE ARE.</blockquote>
            Simple, yet profound. And put across with classic flair. 
            The process of elimination repeatedly appears in Zen philosophy as well, and, being the Zen zealot that I am, it is something that I'm quite 
            familiar with.
            But here’s the funny thing about knowing things.
            Without reinforcement, it is easier to forget than it is to commit to memory.
            And on that charge, on more than one occasion, I plead guilty.
            <br><br>
            Elimination leads to the discovery of our identities. 
            I believe that we are all on the significant quest of seeking our true selves.
            As we wade along, inundated by the barrage of options at our disposal, we often find ourselves facing the headlights.
            We've got a plethora of directions, but we’re more lost than ever. What we really need is a compass.
            Something that just points to the north, with none of the other frivolous navigation BS.
            We don’t need to dabble with a million directions.
            We just need to eliminate every insignificant diversion to end up with the only important direction that we need to know about.
            <br><br>
            Figuring out all the things that aren't you is simple— because it’s easier to identify what we don’t want to be or do. 
            We are more creative when we are constrained.
            Knowing what not to be or do helps create a more bounded set of what we could be or do.
            Which makes it a breeze to filter down to our core identity.
            <br><br>
            From the global list of the things you could be, eliminate the things that you are not/do not want to be.
            Narrow down to a limited set of options.
            Use said limited set and repeat the process until you’re satisfied or until the universe gets sucked into a black hole — whichever happens earlier.
            And that’s it! (Although it is far easier said than done.)
            <br><br>
            Once you do know what your turf is, please write it down and read it to yourself at the start of every day. I can not emphasize this enough.
            <br><br>
            In the material world, your identity is also tied to a lot of external entities. Who you are, to a certain degree, is defined by the people in 
            your circles, the places you inhabit and the things you possess. 
            And life is essentially a thread of experiences, created in collaboration with the three former definitive factors.
            Over a lifetime, a person accumulates a large amount of these links — interpersonal relationships, geographic footprints and possessions; 
            which, in most cases, are not as carefully selected as they ought to be.
            <br><br>
            Review your links — the people, places and things that consume most of your time.
            And review your identity — who are you? 
            Eliminate the links that are stopping you from being who you truly are. 
            Just do that, and there will be a world of a difference. Quoting McConnaughey:
            <blockquote class="bq">Trust me, too many options makes a tyrants of us all. 
            So get rid of the excess, the wasted time, decrease your options… and you will have accidentally, almost innocently, 
            put in front of you, what is important to you by process of elimination.</blockquote>
            So, dear fellow traveller, go discover yourself today. 
            I trust you’ll take action, deciding to stay true to yourself and cut down on everything that takes you away from your identity. 
            I wish you luck as you take this important step forward in your journey. By the process of elimination, may you and I find what we seek!
