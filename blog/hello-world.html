            Over the years, I've evolved from being an unbridled source of ideas with quick-fading excitement to an intentional, practical and 
            (slightly more) focussed doer.
            Perks of getting older, I guess. So now, I write under the assumption that this blog may meet a premature end like many I'd begun before.
            <br><br>
            However, unlike my earlier attempts at writing publicly, every interruption to this blog will lead to a new start again.
            Every essay I write here will be independent of others, and will be relevant even if I pause my writing at some point.
            I may dabble in very diverse topics and may switch topics between posts at will.
            I may not fit everyone's standards of correctness and my views may be based on my assumptions or experiences.
            There will be no fixed frequency of posting. I will write simply and use a conversational tone.
            I'm setting these rules (or lack, thereof) to reduce resistance to execution and increase the project's chances of staying alive.
            <br><br>
            Am I excited? Yes! Beginnings still excite me. A kind of excitement that draws energy from the process rather than the outcome. 
            Here's hoping you get something useful from my writing.
